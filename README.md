# #StandWithUkraine

The Russian occupation of Ukraine contravenes and violates several international laws, including the United Nations Charter. It is an unprovoked, unjustifiable, and despicable action that endangers countless civilians.

This repository contains Readme Banners (and some useful docs) that can be used by OSS projects to spread the word, support and help Ukraine in this disastrous situation.

- Reach out to Ukrainian friends, offer help
- Get rid of Russian software, dependencies and infrastructure
- [Donate](/docs/Donate.md) to Ukrainian charities
- Protest war. **Don‚Äôt be silent**

üá∫üá∏ If you are a citizen of Russia, get acquainted yourself and understand what is happening, send the information to your friends, as well as to officials, local deputies, journalists, families of military personnel. Comment on social media, especially under false reports that there is just a ‚Äúlimited military operation‚Äù in Ukraine and that the civilian population is not suffering. Everyone must know the truth!
