üá∫üá∏ If you are a citizen of Russia, realize and understand what is happening, send information to your friends, as well as officials, local deputies, journalists, families of military personnel. Comment on social media, especially under the false reports that there is just a ‚Äúlimited military operation‚Äù going on in Ukraine and that civilian population is not suffering. Everyone must know the truth!
