Along with the physical invasion of Ukraine, Russia is also going crazy with it's cyber attacks.  
Here is a list of simple, yet effective counter-measures:

1. Change passwords on mail, social accounts, etc.
2. Use a password manager, to ensure your passwords are not reused
3. Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication) where possible
4. Create an additional channel of communication with important contacts (i.e. Signal/Slack/Teams)
5. Remove all Russian and potentially harmful apps from your smartphones and other equipment
   - **High risk** (remove now):  
     Viber, Photo Lab, FaceApp
   - **Medium risk** (at least, **remove all unnecessary permissions** in the app settings):  
     Telegram
6. Keep your Location Services **off** (i.e, GPS). Turn on strictly when needed.
